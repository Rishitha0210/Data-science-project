Our research endeavors aimed to predict planetary radii and classify potential exoplanets using a diverse set of machine learning models. The following key findings emerged from ourcomprehensive study:
Model Performance: We meticulously evaluated multiple machines learning models, includingnLinear Regression and Random Forest Classifier, to gauge their efficacy in predicting planetary radii. Notably, the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 87.04% in identifying potential exoplanets. 
This high level of accuracy is a promising indicator of the potential of our models for real-world astrophysical applications.
Feature Importance: Our analysis of feature importance revealed that specific features within the dataset played a pivotal role in making accurate predictions. Features such as 'koi_model_snr,' 'koi_period,' and 'koi_depth' emerged as influential factors. Understanding the significance of these features provides valuable insights into the underlying astrophysical processes governingexoplanets.
Exoplanet Classification: Beyond predicting planetary radii, our models showcased effectiveness in classifying potential exoplanets. This classification capability contributes to a deeper understanding of the categorization of celestial bodies beyond our solar system, aiding in the identification of candidates for further study.
